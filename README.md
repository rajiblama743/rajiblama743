I am a Machine Learning and Data Science professional with a strong background in Computer Science and a specialization in machine learning. Since 2019, I have worked on projects like real-time image classification systems, mobile applications, and food image classification models. Based in Australia, I provide services in machine learning model development, data analysis, and cloud deployment.

My current project is MechAi, an app that allows you to take a picture of your car's parts and get information about them.
